Privacy Policy for AdBlock Cookie

Last Updated: July 16, 2025

Introduction

AdBlock Cookie is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how the AdBlock Cookie Chrome extension (“we,” “us,” or “our”) collects, uses, and safeguards information. By installing or using AdBlock Cookie, you agree to the practices described below.

1. Information We Do Not Collect

No Personal Data: We do not collect, transmit, or store any personal data (e.g., name, email address, IP address).

No Browsing History: We do not track or log the websites you visit, the content you view, or any search terms.

No Usage Analytics: We do not integrate any analytics, telemetry, or third-party tracking services.

2. Permissions Usage

AdBlock Cookie requires the following permissions strictly for core functionality:

declarativeNetRequest: To block network requests to known advertising domains and strip cookies from requests and responses.

cookies: To remove and prevent setting of cookies on supported pages for enhanced privacy.

storage: To store your extension settings (ad blocking toggle, cookie blocking toggle, and per-site whitelist) locally in your browser.

activeTab: To allow in-context actions like whitelisting the current site on demand.

tabs: To query and interact with browser tabs if needed for advanced whitelisting workflows.

Host Permissions (<all_urls>): To apply blocking rules universally across all websites you visit.

3. Data Storage

All user preferences and settings are stored using Chrome’s local storage API (chrome.storage.local). This data:

Remains on your device: We do not sync or back up your settings to any external server.

Is encrypted at rest: Chrome encrypts local extension storage.

4. Third-Party Services

AdBlock Cookie does not use any third-party services, analytics, or advertising networks. There is no communication with external servers beyond blocking requests to ad domains.

5. Security

We follow Chrome’s extension best practices to isolate extension code and minimize risk.

No remote code execution: All rules and scripts are packaged within the extension.

6. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in the extension or legal requirements. When we do, we will revise the “Last Updated” date and publish the new policy in the extension’s repository and documentation.
